# To do

- [ ] check the language for dishes namees, descriptions : it has to be coherent
- [ ] 'Cuisine' search criteria is weird : what is a cuisine ? Should see what to do with it
- [ ] Page redirection based on type (dish, ingredient, chef, restaurant) (done)
- [ ] Recommendation : maybe limit to 2-3 (to avoid non similar dishes)

- [ ] There are some link dbpedia which is broken: for example, http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arp√®ge_(restaurant), we cannot get any information from this link using the query.
